        The Marketplace is an Online Service Provider for facilitating
        communication between two sets of users: sellers and buyers. Sellers may
        market their sale of items and buyers may peruse and at their option,
        bid or buy the items. The actual contract for sale is between the seller
        and buyer. Company is not a party to the transaction, a seller, or a
        traditional auctioneer. Any guidance we provide as part of Marketplace,
        such as pricing, listing, and sourcing is for informational purposes
        only it is up to you to follow it or not. Also, Company has no control
        over and provides no guarantee related to: the existence, accuracy,
        quality, safety or legality of items advertised or user content; the
        ability or legal standing of sellers to sell items; the ability of
        buyers to pay for items; or that any user will complete a transaction or
        return an item. Items for sale can include physical goods and services,
        as well as digital items such as non-fungible tokens (&ldquo;
        <strong>NFTs</strong>&rdquo;), smart contracts, cryptocurrencies, and
        other digital-based goods (collectively, &ldquo;
        <strong>Digital Assets</strong>&rdquo;). Some Digital Assets may relate
        or interface with distributed applications (&ldquo;
        <strong>Dapps</strong>&rdquo;) and blockchains, including Bitcoin,
        Ethereum, and USDC.<S.AppleTab>&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>

        Some Digital Assets sold on the Marketplace may include NFTs. When
        selling or purchasing an NFT, you agree and understand what
        characteristics NFTs have and how the following terms apply to their
        sale. An NFT is a digital tool that can represent real-world objects
        such as photographs, videos, writings, or music. NFTs are usually built
        using similar technology to digital currencies. But while digital
        currencies are usually fungible, NFTs usually are not. Each NFT is coded
        into a blockchain, contains built-in methods for evidence of
        authentication and<S.AppleTab>&nbsp;&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>proof of
        ownership. When you buy an NFT, the terms of your purchase, and the
        rights you actually purchase and own, may be limited by the terms or
        technology of the underlying NFT. It is up to you to confirm your
        understanding of what you are selling or buying and the license you are
        receiving which is determined by the seller in its sole discretion. The
        license to any purchased NFT is a matter between the seller and buyer,
        and Company is not a party to the licensing transaction. All licenses
        and all ownership interests in any Digital Asset, such as NFTs, shall
        pass directly from seller to buyer.<S.AppleTab>&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>

          You further understand that blockchain transactions are usually not

          exist by virtue of the ownership record maintained on a blockchain,
          and further that smart contracts are conducted and occur on
          decentralized ledgers. Company has no control over and makes no
          guarantees or promises with respect to such smart contracts or the
          functioning of such blockchain or the persistence, or lack thereof, of
          the NFT or related content. In cases where a transaction involving a

        <S.AppleTab>&nbsp;&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>Digital Assets, such as NFTs, are a
        novel and relatively experimental technology.
        <S.AppleTab>&nbsp;&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>Their value, if any, can fluctuate
        with great volatility, and transactions conducted with Digital Assets
        are irreversible. Digital Assets and smart contracts are typically
        described using extremely technical language that is difficult to
        understand and requires a deep knowledge of cryptography and computer
        science. Functionality made available on the Marketplace may have
        inherent design flaws that have not been detected in testing or may not
        perform as expected in conjunction with third-party technology or
        high-volume use.<S.AppleTab>&nbsp;&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>You should
        carefully consider whether you have sufficient understanding of the
        technology and the applicable law before accessing or using the
        Marketplace. Hedera uses gossip, virtual voting and hashgraph mechanisms
        to measure consensus. These technologies and platforms may have unique
        benefits, limitations, advantages and disadvantages. It is up to you to
        understand these factors.<S.AppleTab>&nbsp;</S.AppleTab>

        If a Buyer or the owner of a payment instrument initiates a return,
        cancellation, direct debit reversal, buyer protection claim, or
        otherwise asks their financial institution to open a payment dispute
        (all referred to solely within this paragraph as &ldquo;
        <strong>Dispute</strong>&rdquo;) in connection with a transaction, you
        agree that we may investigate and, at our discretion, re-present the
        Dispute with the payment method providers. You agree to provide timely
        information to assist in our Dispute investigations and understand that
        your failure to provide requested information on the timeline we require
        and as specified by credit and debit card networks&rsquo; and other
        payment service providers&rsquo; rules could adversely impact the
        outcome of an investigation, including forfeiture of the amounts in
        dispute. You will not contest the resolution of any Dispute that we
        investigate and/or re-present, nor will you re-open resolved Dispute
        investigations. You authorize us to pay on your behalf any amounts
        resulting from a Dispute, including costs and fees associated with
        re-presentment.

        reasonable grounds to believe you are carrying out a prohibited or
        illegal activity; we are unable to verify your or your business&rsquo;s
        identity, or any other information regarding your account; or you are

        intended (expressly or implicitly) to survive termination. If there are

        they will be processed pursuant to these terms unless prohibited by law.
        As of the effective date of the termination, you will not be able to
