      request on behalf of someone else, to verify that you are permitted to act
      on that personís behalf. When we contact you to request verification
      information, please respond and provide the information that we have
      requested. Depending on the nature of the request you make, we may require
      you to verify your identity to either a reasonable degree of certainty or
      high degree of certainty. This may mean that we need to match two or three
      pieces of information that we hold about you with information that you
      provide to us. In some cases, we may require you to sign a declaration
      under penalty of perjury that you are the consumer whose personal
      information is the subject of the request or that you are authorized to
      make the request on behalf of someone else. In addition to providing the
      information we need to verify you or your authority, you must provide us
      with enough information so that we can understand, evaluate, and respond
      to your request. We cannot respond to your request or provide you with
      personal information if we cannot confirm the personal information relates
      to you. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable
      consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request
      and to locate relevant information. We cannot respond to your request or
      provide you with personal information if we cannot verify your identity or
      authority to make the request and to understand, evaluate, and respond to
      your request. We cannot delete personal information in those situations
      where our retention is required for our own internal business purposes or
      otherwise permitted by the CCPA (such as fraud prevention or legal
      compliance). In these situations, we will retain your information in
      accordance with our records retention program and securely delete it at
      the end of the retention period. J. Who may submit requests? Only you, or
      someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a request
      related to your personal information. You may also make request on behalf
      of your minor child. You may designate an authorized agent to make a
      request on your behalf by registering such person or entity with the
      California Secretary of State. K. How often you can submit requests? You
      may make a CCPA consumer request twice within a 12-month period. L.
      Response timing and format We make every attempt to respond to a
      verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If
      we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension
      period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our
      written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us,
      we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your
      option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
      preceding the verifiable consumer requests receipt. The response we
      provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if
      applicable. When you request a copy of your personal information, we will
      select a format to provide your personal information that is readily
      useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity
      to another entity easily. We do not charge a fee to process or respond to
      your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or
      manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we
      will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
      estimate before completing your request. M. Non-discrimination We will not
      discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights. You have
      a right not to receive discriminatory treatment by us for exercising your
      privacy rights. N. Other California privacy rights Californiaís ìShine the
      Lightî law (Civil Code Section ß 1798.83) permits users of the Platform
      that are California residents to request certain information regarding our
      disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct
      marketing purposes. To make such a request, please send an email to
      support@goinfinite.io. 13. Nevada privacy rights Nevada residents have the
      right to opt out of the sale of certain ìcovered informationî collected by
      operators of websites or online services. We currently do not sell covered
      information, as ìsaleî is defined by such law, and we do not have plans to
      sell this information. 14. Changes to our privacy notice We will post any
      changes we may make to our privacy notice on this page. If the changes
      materially alter how we use or treat your information we will notify you
      by email to the primary email address specified in your account (if you
      have an account with us) and/or through a notice on the Platform. The date
      the privacy notice was last revised is identified at the top of the page.
